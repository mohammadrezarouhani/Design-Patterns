# The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern
# used in software engineering to create objects by cloning an existing object,
# known as the prototype, rather than instantiating new ones from scratch

# ‚úÖ Purpose:

# The goal of the Prototype Pattern is to reduce the cost of object creation, especially when:

#     Object creation is expensive (e.g., deep copies, complex initialization).

#     You want to avoid subclassing by letting objects define how they‚Äôre copied.

#     You want to preserve object configuration without reinitializing it manually.


# üß† Key Idea:

# Instead of creating a new instance of a class, clone an existing one and modify it if necessary.


# üõ†Ô∏è Use Cases:
#     Game development (cloning enemies, bullets, etc.).
#     UI frameworks (duplicating complex widget trees).
#     Configuration or setup templates (e.g., copying default system settings).
